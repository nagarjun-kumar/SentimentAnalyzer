# SentimentAnalyzer

Designed a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier to create a sentiment analyzer which determines the sentiment of any given tweet as either positive or negative. The dataset used to train and test the model was comprised of 1000 positive, negative, and sarcastic tweets. Built using various NLTK operations such as tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stop words to pre-process my data and receive better results.
